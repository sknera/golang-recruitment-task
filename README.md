# golang_recruitment_task


As it was in recruitment task:
GET: /random/mean/?requests={r}&length={l}

In examples, there was:
{
     "stddev": 1,
     "data": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
}
but standard deviation of [1,2,3,4,5] is $\sqrt{2}$, so in my app this will be the result.

It was not specified what range the numbers should be taken from, so I set it to from 1 to 6 to make the results easy to interpret.
